This project is a minor project completed during the Coding Ninjas course. It involves creating a responsive restaurant menu website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The website displays a menu with various food items, categorized into starters, mains, desserts, and beverages. Users can filter items based on categories and use a search functionality to find specific dishes.
